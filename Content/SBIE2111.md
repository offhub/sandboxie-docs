**Explanation:**

This is an informational message.

Before v1.0.16 / 5.55.16, Sandboxie allowed sandboxed programs to read the memory of any unsandboxed program belonging to the current user, this is obviously a bad idea if your goals is not only infection prevention but also data protection. Hence with v1.0.16 / 5.55.16 onwards Sandboxie will not allow for _PROCESS_VM_READ_ on unsandboxed processes or processes belonging to other boxes.
To facilitate compatibility, this build introduces a IPC option. With `ReadIpcPath=$:program.exe`, any unboxed process can be configured to allow for _PROCESS_VM_READ_ and it is also possible to restore the old behavior entirely by specifying `ReadIpcPath=$:*`.
By default, the only process whose memory can be read is _explorer.exe_. Many processes require it and Windows File Explorer should not keep any secrets anyway. To block this, you can use `ClosedIpcPath=$:explorer.exe`.
