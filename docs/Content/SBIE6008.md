# SBIE6008

**Message** SBIE6008 The configuration %3 of box %2 requires a supporter certificate and can not be used without it.

**Severity**: Error (popup)

## Description

This error is displayed when a box configuration uses features that require a supporter certificate, and the system does not have a valid certificate allowing use of that configuration. Unlike SBIE6004, which warns about certificate requirements and a grace period, SBIE6008 indicates the configuration cannot be used at all without the certificate.

## Typical Causes

- A box configuration enables one or more features gated behind a supporter certificate (for example, certain encryption or security mode settings).
- No supporter certificate is installed, or the installed certificate is not valid/active.
- The certificate is missing required option flags for the specific configuration.

## Suggested Actions

1. Inspect the configuration referenced by the message (`%3` is the configuration identifier) and disable features requiring a supporter certificate if you don't intend to supply one.
2. Install and activate a supporter certificate that includes the required option flags for the configuration.
3. Restart Sandboxie service and driver after installing the certificate so the new certificate is detected.
4. If the configuration should be usable without a certificate, review the feature flags and consult the driver/service logs to find why the certificate check failed.

## Related Messages

- [SBIE6004](SBIE6004.md) — A related certificate-warning message (grace period) that indicates the configuration requires a supporter certificate; SBIE6008 is stricter and prevents use.
- [SBIE6009](SBIE6009.md) — Advanced supporter certificate required (see message resources).

## Implementation Notes and Footnotes

These notes point to where certificate-related messages are managed in the driver/service code. They are written for maintainers and advanced users; exact line numbers are omitted by request.

[ ^1 ]: Message text for 6008 is defined in the English message resource and is displayed as a popup when the driver/service determines the configuration is unusable without a certificate.

[ ^2 ]: In the driver `api.c`, message codes 6004, 6008 and 6009 are remapped together when logging via the API (`Api_LogMessage`) and are treated as certificate-related messages by the client UI. This remapping is used when presenting popups and for special handling in the UI.

[ ^3 ]: See `SBIE6004.md` and `EnableEFS.md` for overlap with EFS and other features that commonly require a supporter certificate; those docs contain implementation details about certificate checks and the UserServer EFS proxy flow.
